## Data description:
penguins_size.csv: Simplified data from original penguin data sets. Contains variables:

●	species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Adélie, or Gentoo)

●	culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)

●	culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)

●	flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)

●	body_mass_g: body mass (g)

●	island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica)

●	sex: penguin sex

What are culmen length & depth?

●	The culmen is "the upper ridge of a bird's beak" (definition from Oxford Languages).

Side notes:

There are 17 penguin species on the planet, but the eight most iconic reside in Antarctica, its nearby islands, and the sub-Antarctic archipelagos of South Georgia and the Falklands.
